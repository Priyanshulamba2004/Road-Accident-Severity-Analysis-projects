## 🚦 Road Accident Severity Analysis  
**Tech Stack:** SQL • Python • Power BI • Data Visualization

---

### 📌 Project Overview  

This project analyzes road accident data to uncover **severity patterns** and identify **high-risk accident zones** using geospatial mapping and time-based analytics.  

It is a complete **end-to-end data analytics solution** featuring:  
- SQL-based data modeling and querying  
- Python-based cleaning, transformation & EDA  
- Power BI dashboard with heatmaps for hotspot detection  
- Actionable insights for **safety improvements**

The analysis supports data-driven decision-making to reduce severe accidents.

---

### 🎯 Objectives  

- Detect **accident-prone areas** using severity scoring  
- Analyze high-risk **time intervals**  
- Understand **vehicle-type involvement** in severe crashes  
- Suggest safety actions to improve road infrastructure planning

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
| Category | Tools |
|---------|------|
| Data Storage & Queries | PostgreSQL / MySQL, SQL |
| Data Cleaning & EDA | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| BI & Visualization | Power BI (Maps, KPIs, Bar & Heat charts) |
| Version Control | Git & GitHub |

---

### 🗂 Dataset  
Synthetic but realistic road accident datasets created for analytics & demonstration.

Files used:  
- `data/accidents.csv` — accident details (severity, location, time)  
- `data/vehicles.csv` — vehicles involved  

Additional documentation:  
- `docs/data_dictionary.md` — description of all columns

---

### 🧱 Database Schema  
| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **accidents** | Severity, coordinates, time, location |
| **vehicles** | Vehicle type per accident |
| **weather_stations** *(optional)* | Weather station info for future extension |

SQL scripts → `/sql/create_tables.sql`

---

### 🔍 Python Data Analysis  

Performed:  
✔ Missing value treatment  
✔ Feature engineering  
 ▪ Severity labels: Fatal / Serious / Slight  
 ▪ Time buckets: Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night  
✔ Severity trend analysis by zone & timing  
✔ Vehicle-type impact evaluation  

Script → `/scripts/road_accident_analysis.py`  
(Exports BI-ready CSVs: `bi_location_agg.csv`, `bi_time_agg.csv`, `bi_vehicle_agg.csv`)

---

### 📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights  

- **Geospatial Heatmap** of severity score  
- **Top High-Risk Cities / Intersections**  
- **Accidents by Time Bucket** (with severity levels)  
- **KPIs** → total, fatal & serious crashes  

(You can connect Power BI to the aggregated CSVs generated by the Python script.)

### 💡 Key Insights (Example Outcomes)  

| Insight | Action Recommendation |
|--------|--------------------|
| Fatal accidents spike during **Evening & Night** hours | Improve street lights & night patrols |
| **Two-wheelers** involved in highest severe cases | Helmet enforcement & awareness campaigns |
| Major hotspots near intersections | Improve signal timing & signage warning |
| Low-visibility zones show more serious accidents | Install reflective boards & speed controls |
